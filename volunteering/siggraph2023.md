# SIGGRAPH 2023
Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH), is an international conference and exhibition on computer graphics and interactive techniques. A lot of technological industries come together to demonstrate their work and innovative tools, and educators and researchers come here to demonstrate research papers. You will mostly see CGI, VFX, VR, interactive art, animations, video games, and other varying stuff involving computer graphics. 

SIGGRAPH has a student volunteer program, for high school, undergraduate, or graduate students that want to be part of the conference. They seek students who demonstrate a passion for leadership, service of excellence, and motivation. Apart from supporting the conference with a diverse of tasks, they get a unique insight into the latest technology and innovation. They meet and learn from professionals, creators, educators, visionaries, and other fellow students.

## My Work
For my volunteering experience, I chose to have Pre-Conference Shifts, these were optional and did not interfere with normal shifts during the event. My volunteering work started on the 4th of August with the Pre-Conference Shifts and one of my first tasks was to organize merchandise for the attendees of the event. Later that day, I got to work with some colleagues in organizing and displaying works, pictures, notes, books, shirts, merchandise, and other miscellaneous items that were the property of the VFX/CGI artist Ed Kramer. This work reminded me of my other volunteering experience at the Museum of Arts of Zapopan because it involved taking pictures of the packages, counting items, and having special care for objects. By the end of that day, I had the pleasure to meet Ed Kramer and take a picture with him next to his booth in the Historic section.

For my second Pre-Conference Shift on the 5th of August, I got to work in the Merchandise store. My task involved organizing merchandise, taking care of stock, and handing merchandise to early attendees.

During the event, from the 6th to the 10th of August, all of my work involved assisting Key Notes and Sessions and helping them at the entrance. I had to greet people, check badges, answer general questions, guide attendees, and keep track of the number of participants in each session. For the most part, it got repetitive and boring, but what made it awesome was meeting new people and talking to fellow volunteers.

## What was valuable
I didn’t attend all the sessions that were planned during the event, but I don’t regret it. What made my volunteering experience valuable during the conference was the people I met. People from all around the world came to SIGGRAPH 2023, some of them very young and some of them very old, some of them artists and others engineers, some who talked English and others who I barely understood. But everybody who came had something to share with others, and that is what I did with my volunteering friends. I shared my life experiences and culture with them, and I also received stories of their experiences and culture.

After a few months, I had the pleasure to give a talk to fellow CS engineers at my school, with my professor [Ken Bauer](https://kenbauer.me/)! This meeting allowed me to share my experience at SIGGRAPH, and motivate students to apply for the next event. You can check this 20-minute talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XU7o5uUUs&ab_channel=KenBauer).
