# Campamento Tortuguero de Sayulita
The Turtle Camp of Sayulita is a voluntary community project with the goal of relocating sea turtle nests and educating locals and visitors on how to protect nests from poaching. Over the last ten years, they have successfully liberated over 260,000 newborn turtles. 

## My Work
My volunteering primarily revolved around translating Spanish to English for sea turtle release events. While the leader of this volunteer community presented their activities and safety guidelines in Spanish to the public, I translated for the non-Spanish speakers. The translation was indispensable because we talked about the correct handling of sea turtle babies and the importance of protecting sea turtles (and other information on how to help the camp). During these events, the attendees were mostly tourists outside of Mexico.

After two weeks of volunteering, I wrote a 49-page document (part of a school activity) sharing my experience volunteering at this sea turtle camp.
