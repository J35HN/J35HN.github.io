# Museo de Arte de Zapopan
The Museum of Arts of Zapopan (MAZ) is the only institution in Jalisco that is devoted to exhibiting contemporary art. It does not have a permanent collection, but it has temporary exhibitions of works and projects created especially for the museum’s spaces. The museum's mission is to generate experiences that encourage reflection and learning through the art of our own time, fostering a dialogue between established principles and new ideas, and making for more complex and independent ways of understanding and thinking about art. 

## My Work
This volunteering experience was helping the museum’s museographers in dismounting and mounting art exhibitions. During the first weeks, I helped in the packing and protection of the current art exhibitions. After that, I helped in the mounting of three works: The Underdogs by Mark Bradford, OJOS OBSIDIANOS by Donna Huanca, and Year of the Usagi by Leiko Ikemura. With these three projects, I mostly learned the “behind the scenes” of a museum; meaning, the logistics of the MAZ, and the care and packaging of artworks for international shipping.

I loved this volunteering because apart from working with the arts, I got to know amazing people from the community. I made friends with colleagues from my school, I got the opportunity to talk and work with local artists, and I saw some very famous local and international people during the inaugurations.

As a gift for my hard work, with another friend of mine, we received over 10 books from the museum storage (great art books by the way), and I got to meet and shake hands with Mark Bradford! Of course, I also received over 100 hours of social service.
