# International Peer
An International Peer at my university is a student (called peer or mentor) that helps exchange students in their adaptation to the Mexican culture and daily life in the city of Guadalajara. This role is very important for our school because, for the majority of the abroad students, it’s their first time visiting Latin America and Mexico. We want students to feel welcomed into our country and city, and we want them to fully enjoy their student experience at Tecnológico de Monterrey.

## My Work
For two semesters, I was assigned a group of 15 exchange students, most of them German and French, with other students coming from Austria, Belgium, and Finland. During their first weeks, I helped by answering their questions about school and Mexico, and by also going with them to the city center to enjoy themselves as tourists.

After, through the semesters, apart from making friendships with my group and other exchange students, I helped out with social events that connected local and international students. We had food and drinks, played typical Mexican games, and dances, and did other activities.

It was a fun experience because the international students made it so. Yes, some cultures from Europe make people more reserved for themselves and their friends, and it could be hard for an outsider to start a friendship; but this wasn't always the case. Many were open to new experiences from the start, and having fun and exchanging culture was awesome. It makes me want to visit the world, and learn and appreciate new food, arts, music, language, places, and most importantly, people.
