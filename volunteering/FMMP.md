# Mexican Foundation of Palliative Medicine
The Mexican Foundation of Palliative Medicine (FMMP abbreviation in Spanish) is a non-profit social organization that helps patients of low resources with terminal illnesses and a low life expectancy of about six months. Their work involves home visits with a multidisciplinary team: palliative medic, psychologist, social worker, nurse, nutritionist, and volunteers. They also offer services of medical attention, medicine, counseling in the farewell process and patient caring, emotional control for patient and family, and medical equipment. Their purpose is to contribute to dignity at the end of life with their palliative care.

## My Work
In a team of 5, we collectively worked on the 2021 Bulletin and a 2021-2022 Institutional Presentation. My responsibility was the Institutional Presentation, which is a presentation that has the intention of being presented in public conferences, and for other social relations. It contains valuable information about the organization: Who they are, their mission and vision, their values, social programs, their model of attention, donation links, and contacts. In the end, two versions were made: a long 29-slide version, and a short 10-slides version. 

This work/project was done in 3 weeks, and it was part of a Social Immersion with my university in the winter of 2022, which granted me 100 hours of social service. The tools we used to complete this project were Drive (docs) and Canva.

Due to my work, the following year the organization gifted me an award/acknowledgment for the impact that the Institutional Presentation had on their social events.
