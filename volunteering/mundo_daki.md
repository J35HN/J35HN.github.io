# Mundo Daki
Mudo Daki is a multidisciplinary studio of art and entertainment where they have produced editorial operations, and animations in cinema, television, and video games. 

Their work contains a simple but transcendental message for all types of audiences to promote wisdom, internal philosophy, purpose in life, valiant intelligence, conscious creativity, and emotional self-control.

## My Work
I worked with a team of five on the proposal of a Kickstarter to raise funds for their second book _El Pa√≠s del Sol 2_. The proposal included most of the necessary content for a Kickstarter: Title and Subtitle, Project Categories, Location, Campaign Duration, Story, Products and Rewards, About the Creators section, and Risks and Challenges.

I worked on content creation: Documents with texts for the funding project, information collection, writings, and English/Spanish translations. I also collaborated with my team on other content: presentations and media. Ultimately, our end products were a Kickstarter Project Draft, and a Google Docs document containing all the writings for the Kickstarter (with additional text explaining other necessary Kickstarter information).

The entire proposal was developed in three weeks. This work/project was part of a Social Immersion with my university in the summer of 2022, which in total granted me 120 hours of social service. The tools we used to complete this project were Drive (docs, slides, spreadsheets) and Kickstarter Project Draft.
