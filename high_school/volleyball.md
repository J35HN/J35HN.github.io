# Volleyball
During my high school I had the opportunity to join the volleyball team. My only experience with competitive sports was during middle school, where I participated in a soccer team from my town, and in a couple of stand-up paddle competitions. 

At first, I was awful, committing horrendous fouls during some volleyball matches. But after some practice with the fundamentals, I had a lot of potential (or that is what my friend told me). My position in my team was Middle, due to having a jump height of 3.15 meters (with the reach of my hand). But I always wanted to be a libero, because I enjoyed throwing myself to save every ball. But, because some teammates were shorter than me, my only position was to be middle. 

I was in the team for two years, and every year we participated in a national competition called ANEPPI. This competition was for private high schools in all of Mexico, and there were academic, cultural, and sports tournaments/matches.

In my first year, ANEPPI took place in Pachuca, Hidalgo, and we placed fourth. There was a lot of growth to take place, and new teammates to come. In our second year, ANEPPI took place in Morelia, Michoacan, and we placed first.
