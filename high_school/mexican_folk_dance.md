# Mexican Folk Dance
In my last year of high school, I was tired of volleyball, so I went with another passion of mine, dance. So, I chose danza folklorica, because I always wanted to participate in these types of choreography.

I was a natural because I love dancing. And we ended up participating in the national competition of ANEPPI in Queretaro, MÃ©xico, only after three months of practice. We did a choreography of folk dance from Jalisco, Mexico, and we won 1st place!
