# Captain
In my high school, there is a competition every year called Blancos contra Amarillos (team white versus team yellow). They split the entire high school into two teams: team white & team yellow. And there is always a theme for the competition, for example, Marvel vs DC, The Simpsons vs The Flintstones, Dreamworks versus Pixar, etc.

In my last year, I was chosen by my friends to be Team Captain for the Yellow Team, and the theme was Simpsons (yellow team) versus Flintstones (white team). I didn’t want that responsibility, because it gets ugly in the sense of what you have to do.

You have to organize the teams for the academic, cultural, and sports competitions. The team for the cheering competition, and a teacher for the choreography. The team for the talent show. Acquire sponsors to pay for the uniforms. Etc. etc. etc.

I accepted, and boy it was a treat. I gave everything to my team. I sacrificed my sleep, some money, time, and energy, but it was worth it. I had an amazing team, and amazing friends that helped throughout the journey. 

We participated in every competition, we won some and lost others. And for our last competition, we presented ourselves with a Haka “ritual”. But in the end, after the cheering competition, we lost.
